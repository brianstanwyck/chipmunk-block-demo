# Chipmunk Blocks Demo

This is a short demo I wrote to familiarize myself with Chipmunk's Ruby
bindings using Gosu. The screen is filled with cyan polygons, and dragging one with a mouse
applies a constant force to it in that direction.

## Requirements

* Ruby (1.9.3)
* The `chipmunk` and `gosu` gems.
